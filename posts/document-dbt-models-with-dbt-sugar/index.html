If you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not too late <strong>especially if you don&rsquo;t have an ELT/ETL workflow that let&rsquo;s your data people (be it analysts, data engineers or data scientists) only focus on writing a SQL <code>select</code> statement</strong>.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t know what dbt is, no one better than the makers of the tool can speak about it and here are places where you can <strong>learn more about the tool</strong>, as well as ways in which a growing number of data teams are using it across the world.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.getdbt.com/>getdbt.com</a></li><li><a href=https://docs.getdbt.com/>dbt documentation</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt>git hub repo for dbt-core open-source</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVpBwKK-ecMEV75y1dYLE5w>YouTube channel</a></li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s start with some context! However, if you&rsquo;d like to cut to the chase and learn more about the tool itself you can jump to <a href=#what-is-dbt-sugar>this section</a></p><h2 id=we-3-documentation>We &lt;3 Documentation</h2><p>That&rsquo;s a fact, good documentation is just a gift from whatever higher-forces of data you believe in. Not just data actually. For example, in my engineering entourage, I often overhear conversations between developers that go something like &ldquo;Oh my god have you ever used the API from &lt;insert_company> their documentation is SO amazing!&rdquo;. By the by, <a href=%5Bgetdbt.com%5D(https://docs.getdbt.com/)>dbt</a> is one, <a href=https://stripe.com/docs/api>Stripe</a> is another.</p><p><strong>The reality</strong>, though, is we&rsquo;re all hiding some pain underneath our smiles and proclaimed love for documentation. Writing documentation is often, and quite sadly, an afterthought in the modern fast-paced data world. So is testing by the way but that&rsquo;s a topic for another time! As a consequence, instead of &ldquo;I love writing documentation, it&rsquo;s one of the first things I do&rdquo; we often hear &ldquo;Yeah&mldr; I&rsquo;ll document this later, it&rsquo;s a small thing, I don&rsquo;t have the time now to go back and forth and update it.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=why-do-we-skimp-so-much>Why do we skimp so much?</h3><p>Why do we skimp so much on something we all recognise the value, joy and enablement good and accurate documentation is to us?</p><p>My feeling, and one that I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people share, is that writing documentation and keeping it up to date kinda sucks. It sucks because it&rsquo;s something else you have to do. It&rsquo;s not a blocker so you don&rsquo;t have to do it in order to make your release work. It sucks because, usually, documentation lives &ldquo;somewhere else&rdquo;. It sucks because it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to keep it up to date in a predominantly incremental and iterative workflow (the <em>de facto modus operandi</em> for most data practitioners). Even in an awesome tool like dbt, it&rsquo;s somewhere else and not automatically kept up to date. That being said, it&rsquo;s not far at all and dbt offers a great way to <a href=https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation>serve this documentation as a webpage out of the box</a> so if you use it, you&rsquo;re already ahead and in a much better place.</p><h2 id=documenting-your-dbt-projects-and-keeping-them-consistent-is-now-a-fun-experience-if-you-use-dbt-sugar>Documenting your dbt projects and keeping them consistent is now a fun experience if you use <code>dbt-sugar</code></h2><h3 id=what-is-dbt-sugar>What is dbt-sugar?</h3><blockquote><p>dbt-sugar is an opinionated CLI tool which helps users of dbt documenting fields and enforcing test coverage on their dbt models. It makes documentation and testing the <em>entitas principalis</em> of data modellers' every day workflow.</p></blockquote><p>If you attended <a href=https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce>Coalesce</a> last December, you will have heard my colleague <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jflairie>Jeff</a> and I talk about the kind of tools that our team at <a href=https://tripactions.com/>TripActions</a> developed to make our workflows more efficient and less human-error prone (watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFNZGZqr5QM&t=411s">Supercharging your data team</a> on dbt&rsquo;s YouTube channel). One of the tools our amazing data engineer <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/virginia-l%C3%B3pez-gil-p%C3%A9rez-3b86ab101/>Virginia</a> built is a lot like dbt-sugar &ndash;that&rsquo;s kinda where the inspiration for it comes from and I coincidentally happen to maintain with Virginia in our downtime under the <a href=https://github.com/bitpicky>bitpicky</a> open source organisation umbrella I started a few months ago.</p><h3 id=ok-show-me-what-it-does-already>Ok show me what it does already!</h3><p>In short, dbt-sugar will guide you through documenting a dbt model in your dbt project. You simply call the <code>dbt-sugar doc</code> task, point it to your model and <em>voila</em> you get an experience such as the one below:</p><p><img src=/img/document_fct_orders.gif alt="documenting a model with dbt-sugar"></p><p>You go from an empty <code>schema.yml</code> to a nicely populated one like this</p><p><img src=/img/fct_orders_schema.png alt="automatically populated schema.yml"></p><h4 id=but-wait-you-only-wrote-documentation-for-the-order_date-column-how-do-you-get-the-order_id-column-to-be-magically-filled-in><strong>But WAIT, you only wrote documentation for the <code>order_date</code> column, how do you get the <code>order_id</code> column to be magically filled in??</strong></h4><p>Good catch! Cool isn&rsquo;t it? <strong>The main advantage of using dbt-sugar is that it knows about the columns you already documented in all of your other models and it populates it for you</strong>!</p><h4 id=it-runs-the-tests>It runs the tests?</h4><p>Yep! No point adding a test if it fails already right? This would lead you to deploy your model, only to have the model fail its assumptions on the next run. When you ask for a test to be added on a column, dbt-sugar will run it for you. If it passes, great it gets added, if it fails you get a message that one of your assumptions isn&rsquo;t met and you can fix it before it ends up in the code base and no-one will ever know!</p><p><img src=/img/test_summary_output.png alt="test addition summary output">
In this case, the unique test <strong>failed</strong> so it was not added and <code>dbt-sugar</code> told you about this so you don&rsquo;t have any surprises.</p><h3 id=what-else-does-dbt-sugar-do-for-you>What else does dbt-sugar do for you?</h3><ul><li>Allows you to document <strong>undocumented columns</strong></li><li>Allows you to re-document <strong>already documented columns</strong> and add missing tests or tags</li><li>Gives you a nice <strong>audit</strong> summary. For example if you do <code>dbt-sugar audit</code> on your dbt model you will get something that looks like this:</li></ul><p><img src=/img/dbt_sugar_audit_task.png alt="dbt sugar project-level audit summary"></p><h2 id=want-to-start-using-it>Want to start using it?</h2><ul><li>dbt-sugar is currently able to talk to <strong>Snowflake</strong> and <strong>Postgres</strong> databases and is extensible to work with most other major databases (feel free to <a href=#want-to-get-involved-in-the-development>get inlvoved if you have access to such other databases</a>).</li><li>dbt-sugar is <strong>really easy to configure</strong> as long as your dbt <code>profiles.yml</code> is set up and you have a dbt project running. All you need to do is <strong>add a minimal set of config options</strong>, which we call <code>syrup</code> (cos it&rsquo;s sweet) that looks like this:</li></ul><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=color:#f92672>defaults</span>:
