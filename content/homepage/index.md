I'm Bastien Boutonnet, I work as Lead Data Scientist at [soda.io](https://www.soda.io/) and am an Amsterdam resident.

I like to build and maintain open-source projects and tools for data practitioners, which I mostly do under the [bitpicky](http://github.com/bitpicky) umbrella.

When I don't write code, I produce music under several aliases one of which is [accuraat](http://accuraatmusic.nl/) and play other people's music to other dancing people in clubs (well, before there was a pandemic that is).
